# clevolution

<p>Please see the <a href="http://nodename.github.io/clevolution/">project page</a> (a bit outdated).</p>

Clevolution started as a library inspired by Karl Sims' SIGGRAPH talk.
The library functions are still here, and accessible from the REPL,
but most recent development has been devoted to the GUI application.

The app has two main tabs, the Current Image tab and the Mutations tab.
Let's look at the Current Image tab first.

When the app starts up it has loaded the expression (we also call it a generator) "black".
This expression appears in the Expression Editor panel, and the expression is evaluated;
this results in an image, displayed on the left.
Unsurprisingly the image displayed by evaluating "black" is black.

Let's get a new random expression by clicking the Fresh button under Generate.
A new expression appears in the editor, and it's evaluated to produce a new image.

The expressions (generators) are randomly generated strings made up of image-processing
primitives in the language of Clisk, the CLojure Image Synthesis Kit -- a DSL and library by Mike Anderson.

Sometimes an expression generated by Clevolution cannot be evaluated.
In this case an image of exclamation points appears, and the Image Status will show as FAILED.
This occurs when the expression is invalid Clisk, usually due to a type error,
for example passing a scalar to a function that expects a vector.
I'm not attempting to prevent this but I am considering implementing automatic
do-over when it happens. (Failure to evaluate is reported more or less immediately;
actual evaluation takes longer.)

And quite often the expression will produce a boring image. Such is life.

## GUI

% lein run



## API

% lein repl

  (use 'clevolution.core)

  (def output-file "images/test.png")


  ;; generate a random expression:
  
  (random-clisk-string)

  ;; generate a random expression and evaluate it, saving the resulting image to a file:
  
  (save-clisk-image (random-clisk-string) output-file)

  ;; evaluate an explicit expression, saving the resulting image to a file
  
  ;; (This one is a Galois field (http://nklein.com/2012/05/visualizing-galois-fields/):
  
  (save-clisk-image "(vxor x y)" output-file)

  ;; generate 1000 random expressions, saving each with its image to a file:
  
  (def output-file-path "F:\\clisk-images\\")
  (dotimes [n 1000]
    (make-random-clisk-file output-file-path n))

  ;; read back the expression that generated the image in a file:
  
  (get-generator-string uri)
  
  ;; show the generated image in a JFrame:
  
  (show-clisk-image generator-string)
  
  ;; show the image file in a JFrame:
  
  (show-clisk-file uri & more)
